  <h3> <strong> What is Kamikatzi? </strong> </h3>
  <p> Kamikatzi is a cute but fierce cat which can bring comfort but also can bite hard.<br>
    Kamikatzi is an alternative persona which has the form of a cyborg cat, half nature, half Machina represents the Yin, Yang and everything in between in regards to music genres as well as emotional spectrum. Kamikatzi believes in the balance in
    every aspect of life, therefore it embraces not only the light but also the darkness. <br>
    The life story of the artist behind this persona should be mentioned in order to explain the origin the birth of Kamikatzi as well as itâ€™s believe system. Once upon a time, in 2012 to be more exact, there was a boy in Vietnam, who had a dream of
    exploring a brand new world, carried on his shoulder the promise to create a better life, started a lonely journey to Germany, the land of the free. He dreamt to be an architect but life took a turn and he graduated as an Engineer. During his
    study, the only thing could make him lose the sense of time is making and writing music. He thought it was just a hobby but it seemed like music has chosen him, not the other way around. Coming from a different culture, and living in a brand new
    world, the artist has to deal with a constant conflict between ideologies and believe systems, until one day he realized, that he had become something in between which doesnâ€™t belong to anything specific anymore. At first he was panicked and
    confused because he lost his understanding about his true identity. However music has taught him, that the infusion of different genres, different philosophies can create wonderful masterpieces. He was a big fan of Linkinpark, a band who also
    supports the ideology of being a hybrid, being different, being a mix. The bandâ€™s musicality has a big influence on the artistâ€™s musical development. Kamikatzi was born to represent the Hybrids created by the clashing between different worlds
    and ideologies. <br>
    <strong> Kamikatzi basically refuses to be radical, one-sided </strong>
  </p>
  <h3> <strong> What makes Kamikatzi different? </strong> </h3>
  <p>The Sound of Kamikatzi is influenced by different ethnicities, different genres, different Emotions, from the far east to the far west, from EDM to classical, from Desperation to Triumph, from dark to light. Kamikatzi dares to bridge the gap
    between different styles in an attempt to innovate by combining elements which are already established and nurtured by generations of musicians. Being a Hybrid between different cultures himself, Kamikatzi tries to emotionally connect with
    people from different ethnicities and cultures and help them overcoming their personal mental struggles with his music, which in return helps him to explore himself more. <br>
    Everyone can make a good sounding song with modern technologies
    But not everyone can make a memorable song, which the audiences can get attached to for a lifetime. Those classic songs always have one thing in common: They all have clear context, great meaning and speak to the heart with honesty,
    vulnerability and authenticity. Kamikatziâ€™s songs will always follow this philosophy. <br>
    Kamikatzi want to express through his music a huge range of emotions from calmness to anger, from sadness to happiness, because all emotions should be embraced, felt and tolerant. Whether the feeling is Negativity or Positivity, they all
    contribute to the emotional growth and should not be hidden or oppressed, because that is how Unhappiness and Depression are born.</p>
